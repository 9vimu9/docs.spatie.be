## Adding hosts

You can add hosts by running:

```bash
php artisan server-monitor:add-host
```

It will ask you what the name of your host is, which ssh user and port should be used to connect to the host and which of checks it should run.

On most systems the authenticity of the host will be verified when connecting for the first time to it. The avoid problems while running the check we recommend manually opening up an ssh connection to the server you want to monitor to get past that check.

Although we don't recommend this you could opt to [disable the host authenticity check](http://linuxcommando.blogspot.be/2008/10/how-to-disable-ssh-host-key-checking.html) altogether. Be aware that this will leave yourself open to man in the middle attacks. If you want to go ahead with this option add `-o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` to the `ssh_command_suffix` key in the `server-monitor` config file.

## Deleting hosts

Deleting hosts is a simple as running

```bash
php artisan server-monitor:add-host <host-name>
```

where `<host-name>` is the name of the host you which to delete.

## Manually modifying hosts and checks

Instead of using the artisan commands you may opt to [manually configure](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-server-monitor/v1/advanced-usage/manually-configure-hosts-and-checks) the hosts and checks in the database

## Listing hosts and checks

You can list all configured hosts with:

```bash
php artisan server-monitor:list-hosts
```

Alternatively you can list all configured checks with: 

```bash
php artisan server-monitor:list-checks
```

## The `apply` method

By default every manipulation will only be applied only once to your image. When calling a manipulation method multiple times only the last call will be applied when the image is `save`d.

For example:

```php
// This will only lower the brightness by 20%
Image::load('example.jpg')
    ->brightness(-40)
    ->brightness(-20)
    ->save()
```

The `apply` method will apply all previous manipulations to the image before continuing with the next manipulations.

For example:

```php
// This will lower the brightness by 20%, then lower it again by %10
Image::load('example.jpg')
    ->brightness(-40)
    ->apply()
    ->brightness(-20)
    ->save()
```
